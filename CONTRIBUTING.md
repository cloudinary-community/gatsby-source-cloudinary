### Your First Code Contribution

This section guides you through submitting your first code contribution for Gatsby Source Cloudinary Plugin. Following these guidelines will increase the chance of getting your contribution all the way to release.

If you are new to open source code contributions, here are some links to get you started:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.Github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.Github.com/en/Github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

Unsure where to begin contributing to the Gatsby Source Cloudinary plugin? Start by looking through these ["good first issue"](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue") issues.

#### Before Starting on Your Contribution

- Add a comment to an exciting [issue](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues) to indicate your interest
- or create a new [issue](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues/new) to indicate what you'd like to contribute.

Either way, make sure you outline your plan of action and ask for feedback from the maintainers before spending too much time on your solution in case it's not within the scope/goals of this plugin.

#### Fork, Clone, and Install

1. [Fork the repository](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/fork)
2. Clone the fork to your local machine: `git clone /git@Github.com:<username>/gatsby-plugin-starter.git`
3. Move into the repository folder: `cd gatsby-plugin-starter`
4. Install packages: `yarn install`

##### Yarn Workspace

The project uses [yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to host the plugin and demo code in one repository.

When installing dependencies, include `workspace plugin` or `workspace demo` in the command, so the dependency is added to the correct workspace. Example: `yarn workspace plugin add lodash`.

Important note from the yarn workspace docs:

> Be careful when publishing packages in a workspace. If you are preparing your next release and you decided to use a new dependency but forgot to declare it in the package.json file, your tests might still pass locally if another package already downloaded that dependency into the workspace root. However, it will be broken for consumers that pull it from a registry, since the dependency list is now incomplete so they have no way to download the new dependency. Currently, there is no way to throw a warning in this scenario.

#### Develop

- Create a branch per issue to work on: `git checkout -b <your branch name>`
- Commit your changes regularly: `git commit -a -m <your message>`

The plugin code is in the `plugin` folder, and the demo code is in the `demo` folder.

- Run the demo with `yarn develop`
- Run the tests in watch mode with `yarn watch`

Run both scripts from the root folder.

#### Pull Request

Before making a Pull Request, make sure:

- You have **created tests** to validate your contribution
- All existing **tests run without failure** with `yarn test`
- The **documentation is updated** to reflect your contribution
- You have formatted the changed files with `yarn format`

After making completing the above list:

- Create a [Pull Request](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/compare)
  - Select `base repository: cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary` > `base: main`
  - and `head repository: <your fork>` > `compare: <your branch>`
- Fill in the title and description following the **[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** standard
  - If unsure about the conventional commit standard, use a descriptive title, and a maintainer will help to make it a conventional commit
- Do not worry about your individual commits, as they will be squashed into one commit with the Pull Request title and description as the commit message

A maintainer will review your Pull Request in the style of [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/).

- If changes are requested, make those changes

As soon as your Pull Request is merged, a new version of the plugin will be automatically [released](#release-process).

### Improving The Documentation

"How to use the plugin" is documented in the [readme](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md).
"How to contribute" is covered in the [contributing file](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Improvements to both are very much encouraged.

You may follow the guide for [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution) or make changes directly from Github.

- [Edit the README.md](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/edit/main/README.md) directly on Github
- [Edit the CONTRIBUTING.md](https://Github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/edit/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) directly on Github
