### Reporting Bugs

Here we guide your **bug report** writing. If you follow our guidelines you will help maintainers and our contributers to understand your bug and help us fix your problem.

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Use the [latest version](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/releases).
- Reread our [readme](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md) and for example configure your plugin thus fixing your bug.
- Check our [bug tracker](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues?q=label%3Abug) and see if somebody already reported your bug or error.
  -  If so, commenting on the existing issue is better than opening a new issue

Read the ["I Have a Question"](#i-have-a-question) if you need help or support.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We track bug reports as [Github issues](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/issues).

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues/new).
- **Use a clear title** explaining your problem.
- Describe **step-by-step how we can reproduce your problem** include as many details as you can. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did what you did.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain the behavior you expected instead** and why.
- **Provide an example showing the steps**. Include links to files, GitHub projects, or include copy/pasteable snippets, we can use when reproducing the bug.
  - If you provide code snippets, use [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
- Please **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you show your steps. If you use the keyboard while following your steps, record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown. You can use [Licecap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) when recording GIFs on macOS and Windows.
- Do NOT include your Cloudinary API Secret or other secrets.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Here we guide your explaining of your **a new feature idea or your minor improvement idea**. If you follow our guidelines you will help our maintainers and our contributers to understand your idea and find related ideas.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Use the latest version.
- Reread our [readme](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md) and see if you can configure your plugin and get your new idea working.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues) and see if somebody already suggested your idea. If so, commenting on the existing issue is better than opening a new issue

### Your Code Contribution

Here we guide your code submission. If you follow these guidelines you
 will increase the chance of getting your code released.

Some links to get you started contributing open source code:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.Github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Using pull requests when collaborating](https://docs.Github.com/en/Github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

Unsure where you can best start contributing code? Read these ["good first issues"](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue").

#### Before You Start Contributing

- Adding a comment to an existing [issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues) indicates your interest.
- Or create a new [issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues/new) describing what you'd like to contribute.

Ask a maintainer if your idea is within our plugin's scope before spending too much time coding your solution.

#### Fork, Clone, and Install

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/fork)
2. Clone the fork to your local machine: `git clone /git@Github.com:<username>/gatsby-plugin-starter.git`
3. Move into the repository folder: `cd gatsby-plugin-starter`
4. Install packages: `yarn install`

##### A note on Yarn Workspaces

Our plugin uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and hosts the plugin and demo code in one repository. You may manually test your changes while developing, because the included demo will use the plugin workspace plugin code not the one published to the NPM registry.

Install in the correct workspace by including `workspace plugin` or `workspace demo` in the command. Example: `yarn workspace plugin add lodash`.

> Be careful when publishing packages in a workspace. If you are preparing your next release and you use a new dependency, but forgot to declare it in the package.json file, your tests might still pass locally if another package already downloaded that dependency into the workspace root. However, it will be broken for consumers that pull it from a registry, since the dependency list is now incomplete so they have no way to download the new dependency. Currently, this scenario will not let you throw a warning.

> <cite>[Yarn Workspaces Docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)</cite>

#### Develop

Before you start coding:

- Create a new branch and use your issue when naming the branch: `git checkout -b <your branch name>`.

Even if most of your code contribute to the plugin, please remember updating the demo and adding tests when updating makes sense.

- Commit your changes often: `git commit -a -m <your message>`.

You'll find the plugin code in the `plugin` folder, and the demo code in the `demo` folder.

- `yarn develop` runs the demo
- `yarn watch` run the tests in watch mode

Your local repository folder's root is where you run both scripts.

#### Pull Request

Before making a Pull Request, make sure you:

- Run `yarn test` and **no tests fail**.
- Update the **readme** describing your contribution.
- The files have the **right format** run `yarn format`.

Then you can:

- Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/compare).
  - Select `base repository: cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary` > `base: main`
  - and `head repository: <your fork>` > `compare: <your branch>`
- Write your title and description following the **[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** standard.
  - If unsure, use a clear title, and a maintainer will help you follow the conventional commit standard

- We will squash all your commits into one commit with the Pull Request title and description as the commit message.

A maintainer will review your Pull Request in the style of [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/).

- If we request changes, make those changes.

As soon as we merge your Pull Request, the new plugin version will [auto-release](#release-process).

### Improving Our Documentation

- We cover "how you use the plugin" in the [readme](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md).
- The text you read now cover "how you contribute".

Please improve both this text and our readme.

You may follow the guide for [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution) or make changes directly from Github.

- [Edit the README.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/edit/main/README.md) directly on Github
- [Edit the CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/edit/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (this text) directly on Github

&nbsp;

## Release Process

Our plugin use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to automate releases by using the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/).
